# Semantic-Segmentation-using-UNET

This project tries to solve a multi-class semantic segmentation problem using UNET on the [Cityscape Image Pairs dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/cityscapes-image-pairs).

## Inputs
The inputs to the model is an RGB image of a cityscape. 

## Outputs
The output is a semtantically segmented mask where different objects are color coded.

## Saved Weights
A .pth.tar file can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1OroW6nzyOo3882BFTUPFQibFUOxO5kUx) containing trained weights of this model for 100 epochs.
